      Words are not enough to explain how much love I have for you, Noelly. My
      love, I am so proud of everything we have gone through all our
      laughs and tears, because it only makes our love stronger. I cannot
      imagine my life without you, your voice, your presence, your smell,
      everything. I can repeat however many times how glad I am that we met, but
      it won&apos;t ever feel enough for me. You are the only person I want to
      be with because you make me feel very joyous, confident, and complete as a
      person. I love you for you, dont forget that baby. I want to go see the
      moon and stars with you and only you. You are the sun in my morning when I
      wake up. Stay beautiful, my love.please accept my chocolate and eat it yar im sorry if i did anthing wrong muaaaa i love you so much harshu<br /><br />
      you are my medicine when you&apos;re close to me <br />- harshitha
